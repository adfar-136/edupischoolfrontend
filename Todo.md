# Todo List

## Frontend API Endpoint Updates - Ensure all requests use localhost:8000

### Tasks:
- [x] Create Todo.md file to track all tasks
- [x] Update Home.tsx to use localhost:8000 for /api/courses endpoint  
- [x] Update Courses.tsx to use localhost:8000 for /api/courses endpoint
- [x] Update CourseDetail.tsx to use localhost:8000 for /api/courses and /api/registrations endpoints
- [x] Update AdminLogin.tsx to use localhost:8000 for /api/auth/login endpoint
- [x] Update AuthContext.tsx to use localhost:8000 for /api/auth/verify endpoint
- [x] Update AdminDashboard.tsx to use localhost:8000 for all API endpoints (/api/courses, /api/registrations)

### API Endpoints Found:
1. **Home.tsx**: `/api/courses` (GET)
2. **Courses.tsx**: `/api/courses` (GET)
3. **CourseDetail.tsx**: 
   - `/api/courses/${id}` (GET)
   - `/api/registrations` (POST)
4. **AdminLogin.tsx**: `/api/auth/login` (POST)
5. **AuthContext.tsx**: `/api/auth/verify` (GET)
6. **AdminDashboard.tsx**:
   - `/api/courses` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/registrations` (GET, PUT)
   - `/api/courses/${courseId}` (DELETE, PUT)
   - `/api/registrations/${registrationId}` (PUT)

### Notes:
All endpoints currently use relative paths starting with `/api/`. Need to update them to use `http://localhost:8000/api/` to ensure they point to the correct backend server.

## ✅ COMPLETED - Admin User Created Successfully!

**Admin Login Credentials:**
- **Username:** admin
- **Password:** admin123
- **Email:** admin@edupi.com

You can now use these credentials to login to the admin dashboard at `/admin/login`.

## ✅ FIXED - Login 401 Error Resolved!

**Issue:** The backend server was missing the JWT_SECRET environment variable.

**Solution:** Start the backend server with proper environment variables:
```bash
cd backend
JWT_SECRET='your-super-secret-jwt-key-for-edupi-school-2024-very-long-and-secure' MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/edupischool' node server.js
